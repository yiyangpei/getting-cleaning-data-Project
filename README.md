## Submission to Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the following files required to be submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

* run_analysis.R: 
The script details the R codes that are used to process the orignial data and subsequently obtain the tidy data set. 
It assumes that the orignial data file contained in the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is in the working directory.  
It outputs the tidy data as a txt file named "Data_Tidy.txt"

* Codebook.md: 
The script describes the variables, the data and the work that performed to clean up the data. 

### Steps on how to use the files

1. Download and unzip the original data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to the working directory. The data will be in a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset".

2. Put "run_analysis.R" in the working directory

3. Run "run_analysis.R". Then the tidy data set "Data_Tidy.txt" will be created in the working directory.
